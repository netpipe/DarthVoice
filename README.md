# DarthVoice
voice changer for qt

WIP only not working as of yet
sound is laggy and choppy also the pitch shifter might not work yet so the soundtouch version was made but its choppy aswell.


if building on macos add 

	<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
	<string>This app requires access to the microphone to capture and process your voice for the Darth Vader effect.</string>

to info.plist
